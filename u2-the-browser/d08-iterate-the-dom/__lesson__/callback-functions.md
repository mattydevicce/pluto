# Callbacks - Passing Procedures as Arguments

## Function Review
- Functions are procedures/subprograms/subroutines/methods. They allow programmers to to create well-defined code *modules*.
- Functions help programmers split a large problem into small chunks.
- Functions allow a programmer to use a well-defined routine multiple times.
- Functions use arguments to accept necessary **"input"**.
- If required, functions use a ```return``` statement to communicate **"output"** (not the *see it on the screen* type of output). Data that should be returned to the location that invoked the method should be sent via a ```return``` statement


## Review Problem
- Write a Mean function that expects an array of numbers as an argument.
- Add an array of grades to each student in the Classroom object included in the Exercises folder.
- Use the Mean function to output the average grade for each student. You should use descriptive output, i.e. "Student name in soandso class has an average grade of XXX"



##Functions are First-Class Objects
In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects. That means that you can treat them as other objects:

 ```js
var procedure = function outputPoem(){
    alert("Mary Had a Little Lamb");
}
console.log("data type of the procedure variable:", typeof(procedure));
console.log("contents of the procedure variable:", procedure);
console.log("name of the procedure referenced by the procedure variable:", procedure.name);
```

Importantly, you can pass a function as an argument to another function. Check out callback_demo.js

Maddingly, there soooo many different ways to declare a function: http://davidbcalhoun.com/2011/different-ways-of-defining-functions-in-javascript-this-is-madness/

## Arrays and ```for``` loops
A ```for``` loop is an excellent tool for repeating code. Arrays are excellent tools for organizing lists of related data. The two often go hand-in-hand.

Some array operations are so common that JavaScript provides built-in ways of expressing them succinctly:

## The ```foreach``` Array Method

- You can apply an operation to every element in an  array by using the **```foreach```** method.
- The ```foreach``` method takes an *operation* as an argument.
- In other words, the ```foreach``` method requires a *function* as an argument. That function gets applied to every element in the array.

## Other Array Methods that take Callback Functions
These methods are more specific than the ```foreach``` method. Each of the following methods modify data from the original array and return a new array with transformed data .

1) **```filter```**
- The ```filter``` method returns an array filled only with elements from the original array that pass a specific test

2) **```map```**
- The ```map``` method returns an array with the *transformed* results of the original array, according to the operation specified as an argument
