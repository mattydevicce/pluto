    <h1>Float My Boat</h1>
    <p>
      So I spake, and quickly they [the men] hearkened to
      my words. But of Scylla I told them nothing more,
      a bane none might deal with, lest haply my company
      should cease from rowing for fear, and hide them in
      the hold. In that same hour I suffered myself to
      forget the hard behest of Circe, in that she bade me
      in nowise be armed; but I did on my glorious harness
      and caught up two long lances in my hands, and went
      on the decking of the prow, for thence methought
      that Scylla of the rock would first be seen, who was
      to bring woe on my company. Yet could I not spy her
      anywhere, and my eyes waxed weary for gazing all
      about toward the darkness of the rock.
