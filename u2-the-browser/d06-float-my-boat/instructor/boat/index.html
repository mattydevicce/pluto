  <p>So I spake, and quickly they [the men] hearkened to
my words. But of Scylla I told&nbsp;them nothing more,
a bane none might deal with, lest haply my company
should cease from rowing for fear, and hide them in
the hold. In that same hour I suffered myself to
forget the hard behest of Circe, in that she bade me
in nowise be armed; but I did on my glorious harness
and caught up two long lances in my hands, and went
on the decking of the prow, for thence methought
that Scylla of the rock would first be seen, who was
to bring woe on my company. Yet could I not spy her
anywhere, and my eyes waxed weary for gazing all
about toward the darkness of the rock.</p>
