// ** TASK ** //
// You are an Archer that is extremely precise and never miss.
// Not even in the bubbly distorted world of JavaScript.

// Add click event handlers to each bullseye ring that will alert when you hit
// your desired target on the bullseye. Since you are in JavaScript
// world your shot could bubble to other rings in the bullseye. Remember you
// have a reputation to uphold, so make sure your shots do not bubble to other rings.

$(function() {
  // Fire away
});
