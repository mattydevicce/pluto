# Submitting Homework

## Getting your Homework

```bash
  git pull upstream master
```

At the end of each day, you'll be asked to pull from the class repo, which will hopefully contain your homework prompt.

Complete all of the required parts, and if you finish early try to do the bonus parts. But remember that sleep is a priority and should not be sacrificed.

When you're done, add and commit your code to git, and then push it to your Github repo.

## Don't Forget to Submit!

To submit homework, submit a GitHub issue on the **class** repo with a URL to **your** fork. Don't forget:
* URL to your submission
* Comfortability [0 to 5]
* Completeness [number of parts finished]
* What was a win?
* What was a challenge?
* Any other comments/questions?
