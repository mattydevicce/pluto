# Episode 4: A New Terminal

## Opening
- What are they going to learn?
   - **Today we are going to get an introduction to the Unix command lines through a Starwars example**
   - **Specifically you'll learn how to create folders and file, copy files, and delete files**
- Why is this material important?
- How will the learning occur?

A long time ago in a unix environment far, far away, there were many Jedi padawans who
will learn to use the terminal and destroy the the Dark Side.

Follow the instructions below using all the console commands introduced in
Fundamentals, class, or that you find on your own.

## Set the Scene

    * "**darth-vader.txt**"
    * "**princess-leia.txt**"
    * "**storm-trooper.txt**"
5. In "**galaxy-far-far-away**", make a directory named "**tatooine**" and create the following files in it:
    * "**luke.txt**"
    * "**ben-kenobi.txt**"
6. Inside of "**tatooine**" make a directory called "**millenium-falcon**", and in it create:

Already feeling comfortable with these commands and want an extra challenge? Try
doing the following:

* Try applying one command to multiple files at once.
* Try applying one command to **all** files in a single directory (where necessery)
* Try applying one command to **all files that match a pattern**.
* Find and use command line shortcuts.
* Try using a mix of absolute and relative paths.
