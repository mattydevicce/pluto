## STEP 1: Atom [I]

Atom is an easy to use text editor developed by the people at GitHub.  While
you can use any editor, for this class we should all be using Atom.

Atom can be installed by downloading it from their website, or through Homebrew Cask

## STEP 2: Opening Files [W]

- How many of you have experience using Text Editors?
- What editors are you familiar with?  What are your favorite features?

## STEP 3: Editor Shortcuts

Your time is valuable, and it is important to get used to your editor.  We
should begin to develop our muscle memory so we can be as effective as possible.

Instead of using the menus, let's practice using the most common keyboard shortcuts:

| Shortcut          | Function
|-------------------|-------------
| Cmd+S             | Save the current document
| Cmd+O             | Open a file
| Cmd+N             | Create a new file
| Cmd+W             | Close the file
| Cmd+[             | Switch to the previous tab
| Cmd+]             | Switch to the next tab
| Shift+Arrow Keys  | Make selection using the keyboard
| Ctrl+C            | Copy the selection to the clipboard
| Ctrl+V            | Paste the contents of the clipboard
| Cmd+A             | Select the entire file
| Cmd+T             | Open a file in by name
| Cmd+\             | Toggle File Pane
