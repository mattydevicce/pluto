# Setting Goals for the Class

### Learning Objectives

- Define Goals, Non-Goals, and Anti-Goals
- Identify goals, non-goals, and anti-goals that will create a positive learning environment
- Establish our expectations for the class
- Practice Writing on Walls and Desks

### Activity

First, read the following essay by Dr. Terry Gray.
<!-- 5 minutes -->
> Goals, Non-Goals, and Anti-Goals
>
> You can't turn around in an IT organization without stumbling upon a discussion
> about goals,  goal setting, and governance.  One definition of "goal" (the one
> not related to sports) is: A result that one is attempting to achieve. Synonyms
> include:  objective, aim, end. target, purpose, object
>
> That all seems pretty straightforward, but I'd like to suggest there are two
> companion terms that can add clarity to goal-setting exercises.
>
> The first one is "non-goals", and it's just what you'd expect: some set of
> objectives which are explicitly out of scope for the current effort.  Isn't
> stating something you do not seek to achieve rather superfluous, assuming the
> existence of a goal set?  I claim it often adds clarity and value to be explicit
> about things that are out of scope, in case there is ambiguity about the
> boundaries around one or more goals, or any tendency toward "scope creep".
> Imagine, for example, if the US constitution included a section on "non-goals"
> for the government... wouldn't that be useful?
>
> The second companion term is more radical:  "anti-goals".  This is a term I use
> to describe things you really, really DON'T want to have happen, whether one is
> designing a computer system, or an organization structure, or a business
> process.  Some candidate "anti-goals" for a computer system might include:
> Inadvertently deleting customer data, Allowing unauthorized access to data,
> Consuming all available resources to the exclusion of other users sharing the
> system.
>
> All three of these terms represent aspects of "design constraints" which is a
> fundamental concept in system engineering, and yet, I believe that
> distinguishing and highlighting such constraints can help people reason about
> problems and priorities more effectively.  For example, while any so-called
> "anti-goal" can be accurately captured as a "goal" by putting a "Don't allow..."
> in front of it, something important may be lost in doing so, namely, focus.
> This gets into the intersection of psychology and design, but many of the "bad
> outcomes you'd like to avoid" will seem so obvious that they might fall into the
> "it goes without saying" category of goals  --which can be very dangerous.  Even
> if some of these bad outcomes are explicitly enumerated in a goal set (e.g.
> "Goal: Never lose customer data.") they may suffer from familiarity and obvious
> truth (perceived as "motherhood and apple pie") when "buried" amongst many other
> specific goals for the system.  Separating some of these negative outcome items
> into the "anti-goal" category allows for the development process to focus more
> deeply on what conditions might permit the bad outcomes, and what measures are
> needed to detect and prevent them.
>
> Of course,  a primary goal can encompass preventing a bad outcome.  One example
> of that: developing a plan to avoid financial collapse of the economy in 2008,
> in which case, anti-goals might include things like perpetuating moral hazard by
> bailing out the bad actors.
>
> Separating items into the three categories described here, rather than just
> treating goals and anti-goals as different flavors of design constraint can also
> be helpful in cultures where "design" and "project constraints" are conflated
> and the latter almost become synonymous with "resource constraints".
>
> Note: I am reliably informed that the correct term for what I call "anti-goals"
> is "hazard", a word used successfully for over a century in the safety
> engineering field to describe much the same concept.  However, the term "hazard"
> may not resonate in all of the contexts where "anti-goals" can be useful, and it
> also lacks the mnemonic value of being part of the goal, non-goal, anti-goal
> trilogy.  So I'm going to keep using it.
>
> What do you think?  Is this triad of terms useful?  Next time you are writing
> requirements for a system or project (or an organization plan), try listing a
> few non- and anti- goals, and see if separately identifying the "bad outcomes to
> be avoided" helps you focus on preventative measures that might otherwise be
> overlooked.

Second, identify for yourself the goals, non-goals, and anti-goals that will create
a positive learning environment.

<!-- 2 minutes -->

Third, discuss with a neighbor. Identify your common goals, non-goals, and anti-goals.

<!-- 8 minutes -->

Fourth, get up and move around. Share back and write your top 3 on the
whiteboards around the room. If you find a similar goal, non-goal or anti-goal,
write "+1" next to it.
