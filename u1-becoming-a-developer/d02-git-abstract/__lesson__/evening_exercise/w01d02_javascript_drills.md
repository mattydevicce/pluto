## JavaScript Drills!

Tonight you are going to write JavaScript statements to solve the following problems. This assignment is to get you to started thinking like a developer.

A starter HTML file has been provided, and will be working inside the `<script>` tags for the majority of tonight. You could just `open drill_starter.html`, but starting a `server` would be more beneficial to you.

Your solutions should be separated by comments

```js

// part 1 solution

```

After you finish each part, it's a good habit to save your work. Do this by committing your changes to `git`.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "finished part deuce"
git push origin master
```

## Completion

Finish up to part 5. You are not required/expected to finish bonus parts. More is better, but healthy living is best. Always make sure you're well rested for the next day, and remember to `submit_hw` before 9:30 a.m. every morning.

#### 1. Pythagorean Theorem

Write a JavaScript statement that can solve the pythagorean theorem.
Don't know it? Google might! :smile:

The program should use `prompt()` to get input from the user. And the answer should be returned through an `alert()`.

The user flow should look something like this (except with prompt windows..)

> What is the length of the first side?

> 10

> What is the length of the second side?

> 20

> The length of the triangle with sides of length 10 and 20 is 22.36.

The last sentence should be a and addition of strings and variable values.

#### 2. Basic Conversion - Pounds to kg

  How would you convert weights in pounds to kilograms?

  Prompt the user for weights in pounds and alert the given weight in kilograms.

> Give a weight in pounds:

> 345

> 345 pounds is equal to 156.489 kg.


#### 3. Killer Caffeine

It's estimated that 6 grams per hundred pounds of body weight can cause death!
Given an 8oz cup of coffee has 95mg of caffeine,
calculate how many cups it takes to kill YOU.

Prompt the user for their weight and output the how many cups of coffee would kill them. Keep this in mind for your time here in WDI...

***For the next 3 parts, you can just output the answer to this one, but make sure it's a concatenation of your answer variable and a string.***

#### 4. Old Modems

How long would it take to download a 25GB ripped copy of Blade Runner over a
$200 56k/s modem from 1995? That's kbps, **kilobit**, not kilobyte. You're going to have to dig for conversion here.

> All this work will one day fade, like tears in the rain.

#### 5. A Long Long Long time

If you drove from Portland to Portland at a steady 55 miles per hour, how many
times could you listen to the Beatle's White Album in full? *Hint* - Save the time in a variable. Pick a unit that makes calculation simple.

**Bonus**

#### 6. Adventure Time!
- Write an adventure story in a paragraph.
- Next, you'll need to remove key verbs and nouns. Your users will enter their own values for these (like MadLibs).
- For example: _Today, I was [  x  ] to [  y  ]! On my way, I encountered [  z  ]! I had to use my [  u  ] to escape the horrible clutches of [  q  ]! All in a day's work as a [  k  ]!_
- You must use `prompt()` to ask your users at least five questions. These questions will determine the words used in your story. These answers should be assigned to a variable.
- You will then need to use string manipulation to build your adventure paragraph!
- **Optional** Try your (or a classmate's) adventure story out!

#### 7. Happy New Year Plutos

Your parents are vacationing on Pluto. They want to wish you a Happy New Years right as the ball drops at Midnight in NYC on Earth. When should they send their message( in Earth dates)? Assign the answer to the variable `messageTime` and output it to the screen with a descriptive message.


### Done? How quaint.
