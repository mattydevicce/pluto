### GOAL 

- Utilize React app to build an app that let's a user search for movie(s) and list them.

- The app should be able to list movies [OMDBapi](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to search for matching movies and then display the results.
 - *Example*: If a user searches for `Star Wars`, a list of every Star Wars movie will be displayed.

#### Deliverables

- Use [SaturnAPI](https://SaturnAPI.com/) to write your app.

- Please send us back a [SaturnAPI](https://SaturnAPI.com/) link with the completed React app.

#### Bonus
- Link an individual movie to a view page that only displays movie about that movie.
