## Intro _(5m)_

### History
Bootstrap was an internal tool used within Twitter. It was concepted from a internal hackathon and was originally known as Twitter Blueprint. Then it's name was changed to Bootstrap.

It really helped standardize the look and feel of all Twitter pages and reuse front-end tools that were already built.

Bootstrap is an entire product, so the average developer would not have the resources to build it. Most don't and will actually write spaghetti code to accomplish their specific task, which leads to unmaintainable code.

The Bootstrap folks realized this and decided to open source it.
