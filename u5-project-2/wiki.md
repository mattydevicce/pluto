## Overview of `Wiki.app`

Henrietta is a business magnate and wants to create a internally facing wiki for
her organization. She wants her employees to be able to write articles in order
to inform colleagues about their insights.

## Project Details

### Necessary features

A basic implementation of this project must include:

1. All articles should display an author so that anyone who has questions about
the contents of an article can contact the author
1. All articles should be editable - Henrietta's is a collaborative workplace
1. If an article is changed, the time of that change should be shown so that
users can know how up-to-date an article is
1. Henrietta wants the articles to be written in markdown so that the content is
visually appealing
1. Henrietta wants users to be able to add a category to an article so that
articles can be organized

###  Advanced features

Going above and beyond the basic implementation is very desirable, should you
have the time.

Feel free to enhance your project with any of the following features:

1. In order to keep users engaged, Henrietta would like a user to receive an
email when an article that they've published is edited.
1. Employees have complained that they feel constrained by a single category and
have suggested using multiple tags.
1. Articles should be browsable by tag.
1. The dev team is interested in consuming the web app's information via a REST
API.  They've asked for end points that return data formatted as JSON.

## Tips

Disavowing pizza and red bull (the stereotypical food choice of developers) you
have decided to explore New York City's salad offerings.

- While browsing your favorite salad blog, you saw an ad for a service called
[SendGrid][send]. You accidentally clicked the banner, but upon seeing the
website you realize this may be very helpful for the wiki you are working on.
- While at Chopt, you overheard two developers chatting about how
[Redcarpet][redcarpet] is a great ruby gem for rendering markdown.

## Implementation

### Technologies

You will be expected to use the following technologies to implement this project:

- **HTML**
  Your HTML should be semantic and valid.

- **Ruby and Rails**
  Your app will need to have its own server.

- **SQL**
  Your app will need to persist data.

This project is focused on server side scripting and persistence, so that should
be your focus.
That being said, once you've got the server side MVP established, you should
turn some attention to the client side.

- **CSS**
  Your app should be pleasing to look at. Your design should take usability into
  account. E.G. if an element is meant to be clicked, give it the appropriate
  cursor, and perhaps have its appearance change slightly.

- **JavaScript & jQuery**
  Your app should have some interactivity
