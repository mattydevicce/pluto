> By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest;
> Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third
> by experience, which is the bitterest. &mdash; Confucius

### INSTRUCTIONS

Each team will tackle an assigned prompt.

Each prompt contains a set of feature criteria. Your team will need to create their own wireframes and flesh out what data you'll track, display, and share.

These projects have many requirements surrounding "roles", such as "student", "administrator", etc.  Before you begin programming, research [Single Table Inheritance](http://samurails.com/tutorial/single-table-inheritance-with-rails-4-part-1/) and [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) to help you  accomplish your objectives.

### STANDUPS

Each team member is required to be present at morning stand-ups, starting at 9:00 AM.

Stand-ups begin with each member discussing what they did the previous day, what they plan to do today and any blockers or potential blockers.

**Afterwards**, the team can discuss how to address the issues and blockers, then coordinate the day's work.

### OBJECTIVES

- Collaborate with your peers as a team
- Pull everything together by building a web application from the ground up.
- Gain experience collaborating and working in a development team.
- Practice integrating topics covered during this course thus far, bridging the gaps between the various areas of a web app (client-side and server-side).
- Use GitHub and Trello to collaborate

### REQUIREMENTS

- A Ruby on Rails and Postgres Application.
- Clean coherent object-oriented JavaScript code; Incorporate a Front End Framework, such as React.js.
- All of your routes should follow REST protocol
- You application must provide authentication.
- Your application **MUST** be on Heroku or Digital Ocean.
- Every team member must be involved.
- Each team must have a bus factor greater than 1

> Use pair programming when writing your code.  Remember pair programming protocol. Driver types, navigator observes and does research.

> This will help ensure higher code quality and ensures your team understands the code base as it is being written.

### SOFT SKILLS

Working in a group is a great way to hone both soft (social) and hard (programming) skills. Each member of each group should identify and share with the rest of their at least one specific soft skill that they want to practice during the project sprint.

Take this opportunity to practice:

- being a team player, accomplishing your assigned goals and coordinating tasks.  **Don't be a [Code Cowboy!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coding)**
- being more communicative about one's challenges and frustrations
- offering meaningful feedback (both positive and negative)
- offering constructive criticism in a way that isn't hurtful or offensive to the receiving parties
- hearing constructive criticism without getting insulted and taking it personally
- being respectful of other people's time (being where you are supposed to be when you are supposed to be there, doing your work on time, and communicating clearly and in a timely manner if you are unable to do either of those things)

### DELIVERABLES

The MVP of an application with a detailed README that features:
- A short description of your Application
  - Team members names and links to their githubs
  - Technologies used
  - A link to your team's Trello board
  - Artifacts
    - Wireframes
    - ERDs
- A GitHub Organization that includes each member of your team.
- A new Trello board that serves as a prioritized list of tasks your team needs to complete during your sprint. This includes user stories, bug fixes, general todos.
- A Lightning talk that:
  - Demos your application on Heroku.
  - Each group will be presenting this talk to the entire class

### RESOURCES

Each project asks for some level of data visualization or interaction. You may find these technologies useful.

- [RSpec/Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) and [Selenium IDE](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) When working on a team, it's important to continously test your features to ensure that nothing has been broken.
