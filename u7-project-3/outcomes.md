### Student Portal

A student may log in and update their profile with employment status, contact info, and skills.

### Outcomes Portal

An outcomes officer may log in and view the info in the profile of a particular graduate, info from a entire class, or info from the immersion program as a whole.

The outcomes officer can view the percentage of students who currently have jobs, and the percentage who got jobs in the first 90 days post-graduation within a specific class and across an immersive program, using graphics to help understand the information.

### Hundred Day Survey

Students who graduated over 100 days ago should be elligible to receive a 100 Day Survey.

An Outcomes officer can view a list of students by class and send out links to the survey.

### From Outcomes to Alumni

The graduated students should receive an email that links back to the Outcomes Tracker to fill out a survey.

Once a student completes the 100 Day survey and states they are "employed" they become an "Alumni"

Until a student becomes an "Alumni" they are considered an "Outcome"
