### Alumni Portal

Graduated students can sign up for a public facing profile page, which includes a picture of them and an uploaded resume.

They can add skill tags and links to any relevant projects.

They can answer questions about themselves so potential employers can get a better sense of who they are.

### Employer Portal

Employers can search for candidates by skill sets.

If employers find a candidate they like, they can email that alumni, based on the contact information that the alumni provided in their profile.

Employers can track keywords and receive email alerts when their tracked preferences match new alumni profiles.

### Outcomes Portal

Outcomes officers can track analytics on Student profiles and employer searches, and see graphics that help them understand the data.
