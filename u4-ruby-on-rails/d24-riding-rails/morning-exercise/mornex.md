Using the files provided(`nba_season_2011-12.csv` & `seeds.sql`) while working in the correct directory do the following:
<br>
Using the `pwd` command, find the path to your current working directory, copy the path, and paste it into `seeds.sql` on line 17 so it should say something along the lines of
<br>
`FROM '/Users/Bobby_King/code/wdi/pluto/u4-ruby-on-rails/d24-riding-rails/morning-exercise/nba_season_2011-12.csv'`
<br>
*(Note: this is the path on MY computer, not yours so don't use that exact path)*
Once that file has been modified, run this line from your terminal:
<br>
-`createdb nba_db`<br>
-`psql -d nba_db -f seeds.sql`<br>
Navigate to your nba_db using the PSQL CLI and then move onto the exercise.
