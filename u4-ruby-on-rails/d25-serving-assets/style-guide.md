# Hey Pluto!

We have a job to do!  We need to build a "style guide".

##### STORY 1:
I need a web application (Rails), with a page containing: typography, form fields, hyperlinks and buttons.  Use Lorem Ispum or whatever you think will look good.

**As a** Mobile Marketing Jedi
**I want** a style guide
**so that** I can see the appearance of our application and ensure it complies with company "Brand Guidelines".

**ACCEPTANCE:**

*TYPOGRAPHY*
- I can see all of the headers `<h1>` to`<h6>` appropriately styled.
- Block levels, like `<p>`, `<a href>` and `<blockquote>` must be represented

*FORMS*
- `<input>` for text, password, checkboxes and radio boxes.
- `<select>` with `<option>`s.
- `<textarea>`

*BUTTONS*
- `<button>` and `<input type="submit">`
- A link that looks like a button `<a href="#" class="button">`
- A `big` button
- Different color styles for:
  - `primary` (more noticible)
  - `secondary` (less noticible)
  - `dangerous` (red text)
  - `secondary dangerous` (together)

---

##### STORY 2:

**As a** Mobile Marketting Jedi<br>
**I want** to organize styles into categories<br>
**so that** I can flip between them more easily<br>

**ACCEPTANCE:**
- I can switch between categories with a click.
- I'd like to to be as snappy as possible.
