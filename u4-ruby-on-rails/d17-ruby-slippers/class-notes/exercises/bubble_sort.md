# Bubble Sort

Today you will be writing a simple sorting algorithm in Ruby! You will
***not*** be allowed to use `.sort`, `.sort_by`, or any other Ruby
methods for this exercise. Your sorting algorithm should be able to sort
the following array of numbers in order from greatest to least:

```ruby
numbers = [5, 2, 12, 7, 56, 42, 34]
```

### Bonus
Allow the user to pass a command line argument which will either run the
sort from greatest to least, or from least to greatest.

```
$ ruby sort.rb
ascending
[2, 5, 7, 12, 34, 42, 56]
```
