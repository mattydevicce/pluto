Congratulations on completing your first project sprint! Be proud of yourselves Pluto!

## Entering Ruby

Today we learned the basics of computer networking, and how web servers operate. We're going to be writing our web servers in a new( to yous ) language called Ruby.

Tonight's assignment is a chance for everyone to wind down, relax, and recover with a bit of light reading from [Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby](http://www.rubyinside.com/media/poignant-guide.pdf), written by the enigmatic [_why?](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/03/ruby_ruby_on_rails_and__why_the_disappearance_of_one_of_the_world_s_most_beloved_computer_programmers_.html).

Completion for tonight's reading is to finish at least the first chapter of the book, and to get some sleep (***seriously***).

###Bonus

If you find yourselves with a lot of free time, you can spend some of it practicing Ruby using the tutorials below:


- [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/ruby)
- [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby)
- [Ruby Monk](https://rubymonk.com/)

Alternatively you can just peruse the Ruby docs, for a glimpse of what's to come.
